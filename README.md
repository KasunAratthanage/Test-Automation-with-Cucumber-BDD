# Test-Automation-with-Cucumber-BDD

A cucumber is a tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework which is used to write 
acceptance tests for the web application. It allows automation of functional validation in easily 
readable and understandable format (like plain English) to Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, etc.

Behavior Driven testing is an extension of TDD. Like in TDD in BDD also we write tests first and the 
add application code. The major difference that we get to see here are

Tests are written in plain descriptive English type grammar
Tests are explained as behavior of application and are more user focused
Using examples to clarify requirements
This difference brings in the need to have a language which can define, in an understandable format.
